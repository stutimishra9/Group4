Group 4 - Anshul Sarin &amp; Stuti Mishra -Tools for Analytics Project
We chose the following zip code where Stuti lives: 10019

We used pandas library functions to implement the tasks in the project so assigned. First we retrieved the entire data set using pandas data frame and then filtered it using column attributes to get parking incidents information for our chosen zip code 10019. 

We also computed the total number of parking incidents in our ZIP, and the total number of all incidents. This fraction is smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes.
